**AHP is a provably enforceable architectural framework that reconstitutes hesitation as infrastructural capacity rather than inefficiency.**  
It demonstrates that **the absence of deliberative time in algorithmic systems is a political choice, not a technical necessity.**

### 📄 About this work

This is a **self-contained scholarly article** at the intersection of Science and Technology Studies, control theory, and critical technical practice. It proposes **Algorithmic Hysteresis Primacy (AHP)** — a framework that treats hesitation as architectural infrastructure — and provides **formal proofs, protocol specifications, reference implementations, and governance frameworks** as independently verifiable supplements.

**Genesis and method:**  
This work originates from a single philosophical question — *“how can we prevent the pursuit of zero latency in artificial neural systems from eroding human agency?”* — posed by a researcher with no formal training in engineering or the exact sciences. Through an iterative process of **specification, multi-perspective adversarial critique, and convergent refinement**, every technical layer was generated, challenged, and revised until multiple synthetic interlocutors attested to its internal consistency.  

> *The author's lack of conventional credentials is not concealed — it is integral to the work's central claim.*

### 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description | Political Function |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Synthetic Inertia** | Architectural resistance via hysteresis bands (ΔΓ) | Prevents instantaneous state transitions |
| **Cognitive Buffering** | Mandatory deliberation windows (Δt_min > 0) | Preserves human oversight and veto capacity |
| **Temporal Sovereignty** | Community-determined temporal rhythms | Self-determination against imposed acceleration |
